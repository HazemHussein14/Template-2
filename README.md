## Usage

The Kasper Template is designed to be a starting point for your own website. You can customize the template by modifying the HTML and CSS files to suit your needs. 

### HTML

The HTML file `index.html` contains the structure of the template. You can modify the HTML tags, add new sections, or remove existing ones to create your own website.

### CSS

The CSS file `kasper.css` contains the styling of the template. You can modify the CSS properties to change the colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects of the template. The template uses both flexbox and CSS grid for layout. FontAwesome is used for icons, and normalize.css is used to normalize the page.

### Images and Video

The `images` folder contains the images and video used in the template. You can replace these files with your own to personalize the template.
